# Meza1 Sources

This directory will contain certain files that are preferably kept with the Meza1 repository rather than downloaded from another source.

## Apache Files

The Apache files are kept with Meza1 because the Apache Foundation only keeps the latest versions directly available on their website. By contrast, PHP and Node.js have all versions available such that Meza1 can say "download version 1.2.3" and that version will continue to be available even when 1.2.4 is released.
