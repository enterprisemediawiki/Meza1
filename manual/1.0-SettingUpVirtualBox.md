# Setting up VirtualBox

These are the high-level steps required to get a meza installation up and running on your computer.

## Downloads and Installs
1. Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  1. On Windows only, you also need to use this for the Git Bash terminal (once installed right click on any window and select "git bash here")
1. On Windows only, install [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) (You probably want the "Windows MSI installer")
1. Download [CentOS 7 minimal install](http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/) into your home directory (e.g. `echo $HOME`)
1. Clone the meza repository in your terminal: `cd $HOME && git clone https://github.com/enterprisemediawiki/meza`

## Create a new VM
5. Create a new Virtual Machine (VM) in VirtualBox:
  1. Change to meza's scripts directory: `cd meza/scripts`
  2. Run the Create VM script: `./create-vm.sh` and follow the prompts. You need at least 10GB of disk space for a basic install.
6. Install CentOS onto your new VM: Start the VM and follow the prompts.

## Configure the VM
7. Once installed, you'll need to get networking started. Unfortunately in these first few steps you can't copy/paste, so you'll have to type these manually:
  1. Start the necessary network `sudo ifup enp0s3`
  2. Get the VM network setup script: `curl -L vbox.getmeza.org > vbox`
  3. Run the VM network setup script: `sudo bash vbox`
  4. Confirm SSH works (both commands assume you used the default IP address in the `dev-networking.sh` step above):
    1. For Mac/Linux/Unix, open your terminal and run `ssh root@192.168.56.56` or `ssh yourusername@192.168.56.56`
    2. For Windows, open PuTTY and type 192.168.56.56 into the "Host Name (or IP address)" field and hit "Open" then login with your credentials
8. Shutdown your VM: `sudo shutdown -h now`
9. Take a snapshot and call it something like "baseline configuration". Click the "snapshots" icond in the top-right of VirtualBox and then click the camera icon. You'll be able to jump back to this point at any time.
10. Go back to the main [README](../README.md) and follow the steps to install meza
