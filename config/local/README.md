Local configuration directory
=============================

This directory is used for configuration of your specific meza instance. Other configuration files outside this should not be edited, but this is for individual customization of the entire meza setup. Customization of specific wikis is handled in `/opt/meza/htdocs/wikis/<wiki-id>/config`.
